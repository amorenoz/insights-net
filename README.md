# insights-net

Network analysis tool based on [insights-core](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-core).

It provides:

- A set of plugins that support parsing networking-related logs
- A CLI tool that allows running commands to extract information from log archives.

## Getting started

After cloning the repository, create a venv and install the tool

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

    $ python -m venv venv && . ./venv/bin/activate

Install the tool:

    $ (venv) pip install .

## Run insights shell

`insights-net` supports connecting to a running instance of insights shell and
extract information from it. For more details about `insights shell`, visit the
[insights documentation](https://insights-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Run `insights shell` on kernel-mode ("-k" or "--kernel") on the archives you want to analyze and specify the load insights-net plugins:


    $ insights shell -k  -p insights_net.plugins samples/ovn/sosreport-compute-0-2021-06-03-awkezkh samples/ovn/sosreport-controller-0-2021-06-03-qjzsrnv
    NOTE: When using the `ipython kernel` entry point, Ctrl-C will not work.

    To exit, you will have to explicitly quit this process, by either sending
    "quit" from a client, or using Ctrl-\ in UNIX-like environments.

    To read more about this, see https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/2049


    To connect another client to this kernel, use:
        --existing kernel-3973772.json


Now, in another terminal, you can run insights-net to introspect the archives:

    $ insights-net
    Usage: insights-net [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    Options:
      -v, --verbose  Be verbose
      --help         Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      find-ip  Get all the available information regarding an IP(v4/6) address
      host     Show basic host information
      info     Show basic information of the archives
      ovn      Show the OVN configuration
      stop     Stop the background running insights kernel


## Extracting data from running running OVSDB servers

`insights-net` has a plugin that supports extracting OVS, OVN NB and OVN SB information from a running ovsdb-server that serves such databases.

In order to use it, start an ovsdb-server you want to inspect (you might want to use the help of [ovs-offline](https://ovs-dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ovs-offline.html)). **Note only unix-domain socket transport is supported.**

Then, just add the directory where the socket file stored to the `insights shell` command line as another archive, e.g:


    insights shell -k -p insights_net.plugins /var/run/openvswitch


You can now examine the OVS or OVN databases using the insights-net command line:

    insights-net ovs list {TABLE_NAME} [--list]

or

    insights-net ovn nb list {TABLE_NAME} [--list]

or

    insights-net ovn sb list {TABLE_NAME} [--list]

Other commands (such as `insights-net find-ip`) will also process information from such OVSDB instances


## Example commands:

Dump a brief summary of the host information:

    $ insights-net host
